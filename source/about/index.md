### Yilei Fu's Research Statement <small> as an undergraduate student</small>
<p align="justify">
    During my undergraduate study procedure, I have accessed lots of different areas in computer science. I took many courses in diverse research fields, such as machine learning and deep learning, computational bioinformatics, computer vision, and natural language processing. I joined the massive data computing lab in our university for my own interest because I believe massive data research experience can be a good foundation for expanding my future research career in different research fields. In the lab, I was supervised by Prof. Hongzhi Wang for a topic of dealing with massive queries on knowledge bases when people executing data cleansing tasks on it. I produced a novel efficient structure for combining queries in graph form, and do the graph matching tasks on RDF formed knowledge bases. With the foundation of the previous research experience, I have already known the basic procedure of doing research. With the more I learn in the university, the more I think I should explore in unknown fields. There are many fields that I am currently interested to, such as bioinformation, NLP, and machine learning. In my opinion, today’s scientific research is more and more rely on massive data, like gene data, vision data and text data, etc. Biocomputing and NLP are two major paths I would like to explore more in the future, but I might only be able to do either one. In the Biocomputing field, I have joined HIT's Bioconputing lab for one year, and published two papers about DNA sequenceing. As to Natrual Language Processing, I am mainly interested in information retrival and text data processing. All these work I mentioned above requires massive data computing techniques and artificial intelligence methods, which I have already explored boardly during my undergraduate study procedure.<br>
    <strong>My research interests</strong> can be briefly described by solving different problems through using massive and artificial intelligence methods, which includes bioinformatics, natural language processing and machine learning algorithms developing.
