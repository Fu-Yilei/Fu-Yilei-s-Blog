**About Yilei Fu**

**I am now a Ph.D. student at Rice University, Computer Science Department. My adviser is Prof. Todd Treangen.**

### Yilei Fu's Research intrest 
<p align="justify">
During my undergraduate study procedure, I have accessed lots of different areas in computer science. I took many courses in diverse research fields, such as machine learning, bioinformatics, computer vision, and natural language processing. During 2018-2019, I have done several researches on human genome structure variation detection and alignment algorithm refinement on protein sequences in Center for Bioinformatics at Harbin Institute of Technology(HIT) with Professor Wang, Yadong. With the foundation of the previous research experience, I became familiar with the basic procedures of doing research in bioinformatics area.

The more I have learned in the university, the more I think I should explore in unknown fields. There are so many fields in bioinformatics that I am currently interested to, such as Metagenomics, Structure Variation Calling, Sequence Alignment Refinement and etc.. I have decided to join Professor <strong>Todd Treangen’s lab</strong> as my first research action after I joined Rice.

Now, I am working on detecting Structure Variations in Metagenome, which is more challenging and exciting.
